            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p> name is a non-profitable Organization that aims to directly benefit the underprivileged parts of our
                society.The proposed project strives to help those people who are in search of basic needs
                with the help of local community engaging in charity work. It is a setup in such a way that
                all contributors and beneficiaries may join up and help one another.</p>
            <p>Generally, what we do when don't need a particular thing in our closet or in our homes? We throw it
                in the garbage without having a single thought.Our aim is to donate these things.We can keep track of
                discarded or unneeded items because we
                believe that what is rubbish to one person may be percious to another.We can donate these things with
                the help of local NGOs.For an emerging nation like INDIA,underprivileged
                community holds an important role in nation devlopment.Atleast they should have basic needs.We strongly
                beleieves that unless
                members of civil society are involved proactively in the process of devlopment,sustainable change
                will not happen.Anyone can use this website from the comfort of their home, you just need to
                provide some important information about yourself and list down the items you want to donate, and a
                local NGO of your area can pick it up according to your preffered timing and give it to someone who need
                that thing.
                It is an immense pleasure to offer someone anything that he can use . who knows,
                may be you will get something of equal worth in return.
